#### CC3K

this is a c++ project which is make by me and my university friends such as a final project of course CS 246.

To use this game, should put the Makefile into all files in folder "src", and run makefile in a Linux environment. 

commend:

$ cc3k

open the game

one of "no","so","ea","we","ne","nw","se","sw" to move and select direction

"a" and "u" to use item

$ cc3k -

open the game with a better graph.

also support w a s d to choice the direction, do not have to input graph.



Game holds floor and accept input from user, transfer a command into floor, output result while the game running. Which is the major part to manipulate all of the IO stuff.
